# Design and Analysis of Algorthms-check
#  Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Problem Set

Welcome! 
This notebook contains solutions to a set of classic algorithm problems, implemented in Python. The focus is on building a solid understanding of core algorithmic techniques like recursion, sorting, and data structure manipulation — with clean, readable code.

Whether you're revising for an algorithms course or brushing up on your fundamentals, these examples are simple, clear, and easy to follow.

##  Problems Covered

### 1. 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Recursive)
A classic optimization problem solved using recursion. Given weights and values of items, the goal is to find the most valuable subset that fits within a given weight limit.

### 2. Character Frequency Counter
Reads a user-input string and counts how many times each character appears. Demonstrates basic text processing and dictionary usage.

### 3. Reverse a List Using Indexing
Takes a list of integers and reverses it using Python's indexing features. A quick dive into list slicing and iteration.

### 4. Sorting a Dictionary by Value
Sorts a dictionary in ascending order based on values using Python’s `sorted()` function and `lambda` expressions.
